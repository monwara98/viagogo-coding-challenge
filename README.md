# Viagogo Coding Challenge

The assumptions that I have made:
1. Some events can have the same coordinates
2. All coordinates have 1 event
3. The coordinates will be whole numbers and not decimals, as well as the distance
4. If a coordinate is found to be larger than 10, then it is made to be equal to 10
5. If a coordinate is found to be smaller than -10, then it is made to be equal to -10
6. The user will follow instructions and not input values greater than 10 or smaller than -10 for the coordinates
7. The price of the tickets is of type int

# Questions
1. How might you change your program if you needed to support multiple events at the
same location?


2. How would you change your program if you were working with a much larger world
size?
